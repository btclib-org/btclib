- of a signature: verify or verification ? of a commit: verify or open ?
- better mimic of electrum entropy search, they probably have the words inverted
- BIP44 in address_from...
- primitives for interactive threshold and musig
- borromean references
- generalize ec, hf in borromean
- Edwards curve (Curve25519)
- BLS
- wherever a Curve is required, accept also a network str ?
- remove signtocontract, adding commit to dsa and ssa
- compare with test_framework

- report test vectors from P. Todd's library
- report trailing/leading blank trimming in Electrum message signing
- report BIP39 whitespaces
- SSA: ask about checking e=0
- SSA: ask about why e=e(k), making impossible to select e, k indipendently
- SSA: ask about m being 32 bytes
- SSA: ask about benefit of pIsThreeModFour vs odd or low
- SSA: ask about benefit of removing 02/03 from pubkey
- SSA: suggest better k


revise y_odd: why int as second parameter? why not bool?

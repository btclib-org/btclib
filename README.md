## Bitcoin & Blockchain Technology

Python library (and assorted material) originated from the Bitcoin and Blockchain Technology course of Milano Bicocca and Politecnico di Milano Universities.

The `btclib` folder contains Python code, namely Python3 with type annotation. Most of the material is instrumental in teaching and homeworks, algorithms are intended for demonstration and not to be used in production environments: they could be broken using side-channel attacks! Moreover, they will probably have major refactorings without care for backward compatibility.

# Tests, code coverage, and profiling

## Install required packages

```shell
uv sync
```

uv takes care of the virtual environment: every command below runs inside
it, thanks to the `uv run` prefix.

## Test and code coverage

Test execution is distributed across multiple cores,
with the number of cores being chosen automatically:
this can be changed in the addopts option of pyproject.toml

The ultimate comprehensive way of running the tests is

```shell
uv run pytest --cov-report term-missing:skip-covered --cov=btclib --cov=tests
```

If you want to contribute to btclib, please ensure that it succeeds.

Coverage results can also be reported as html at htmlcov/index.html:

```shell
uv run coverage html
```

Finally, the fastest test execution can be accomplished running pytest only

```shell
uv run pytest
```

## Profiling

Profiling can be obtained with:

```shell
uv run python -m cProfile -s time -m pytest
uv run python -m cProfile -s cumtime -m pytest
uv run python -m cProfile -o btclib.prof -m pytest
```

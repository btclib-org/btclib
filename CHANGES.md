# Release notes

Notable changes to the codebase are documented here.
Release names follow [*calendar versioning*](https://calver.org/):
full year, short month, short day (YYYY-MM-DD)

## v2020.5 (not released yet)

Major changes includes:

- made entropy the first input parameter of mnemonic_from_entropy
- P2PK and P2MS now handle also compressed public keys
- improved size checks for bytes_from_octets
- entropy.generate_entropy has been renamed as entropy.generate
- added gen_keys to dsa, ssa, bms, so that now all the standard
  gen_keys, sig, and verify functions are available
- Generic public/private Key accepted wherever PubKey is expected
  (except for Schnorr where a public key cannot be discriminated as
  different from a private key)
- Wherever input/output parameters had a
  'compressed: bool, network: str' sequence, the order has been
  inverted resulting in 'network: str, compressed: bool'.
  Affected functions: base58address.p2pkh, base58wif.wif_from_prvkey,
  to_prvkey.prvkey_info_from_prvkey, to_pubkey._bytes_from_xpub,
  to_pubkey.bytes_from_key, to_pubkey.pubkey_info_from_prvkey,
  hashes.hash160_from_pubkey, secpoint.bytes_from_point,

## v2020.4.21

Major changes includes:

- The Bitcoin Message Signing module btcmsg.py has been rename bms.py
- refactored address/scriptPubKey
- consolidated wif_from_* in wif_from_prvkey
- removed ambigous functions going from prvkey to address
- refactored to_pub and to_prv functions
- added network <-> prefix <-> curve functions in network module
- removed trailing _scriptPubKey suffix from the function names
  in the scriptPubKey module
- tests are now distributed as btclib.tests subpackage
- removed p2pkh_from_xpub, p2wpkh_p2sh_from_xpub, and p2wpkh_from_xpub
  (use p2pkh, p2wpkh, and p2wpkh instead)
- introduced CurveGroup and CurveSubGroup as grand-parent and parent
  of Curve. Also, renamed ec._p as ec.p and removed default parameters
  from double_mult
- renamed ec.opposite(P) as ec.negate(P)
- the usage of DER (de)serialization is advocated through
  dsa.(de)serialize, similarly to ssa.(de)serialize
  and bms.(de)serialize; therefore, the corresponding
  der.py functions have been renamed with leading underscore
- introduced XXXSig and XXXSigTuple for XXX = DSA, BTCMSG, and SSA

## v2020.4.7

This is a major release that complete the far-reaching refactoring
initiated with v2020.3.20; it requires python>=3.8 as we use TypedDict.

Chances are this release might break most projects using btclib,
but the changes were long overdue and should be stable in time.
Functions and modules have been renamed to better reflect
the library design; anyway, because of the clearer logic,
it should not be hard to find the new versions.
The module alias.py might be a good entry point
to familiarize with the new design.

Most notably the library is now able to accept
any representation of private keys as input,
with all the WIF/BIP32/bytes/integer conversion
auto-magically being taken care of.
The same apply to public key BIP32/SEC-bytes/tuple conversion.
As usual, whenever bytes are accepted, hex-string or
text string are accepted too, as appropriate.

Moreover, major changes include:

- updated the Schnorr implementation to BIP340 proposed standard
- refactored BIP32 for increased derivation efficiency
- improved documentation
- extended functional test case coverage (as usual tests cover 100% of
  the code base)
- removed all mypy warnings (but one)

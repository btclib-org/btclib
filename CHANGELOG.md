Every change of a release, in full: what changed, why, and what it cost.
The release notes, which say what a user has to *act* on, are in
[RELEASE_NOTES.md](./RELEASE_NOTES.md); this file is the record behind
them.

A release's own pull request writes the release's section, from the squash
subjects since the previous tag, and no other pull request adds an entry
(sections 9 and 12 of the
[organization's standard](https://github.com/btclib-org/.github)).

Only v2026.8.7 and what follows it are recorded in the changelog at all.
The releases before it were documented at release-notes length in the
first place, and are still in [RELEASE_NOTES.md](./RELEASE_NOTES.md)
rather than duplicated here.

This file carries the most recent release, and a `(work in progress…)`
section where one remains; every release before it has a file of its own
under `changelog/`, holding that release's section and nothing of any
other. Past a size ceiling GitHub's contents API answers a file with an
empty `content` at HTTP 200, which reads as an empty file rather than as
an error, and one file per release is what keeps each of them under it.

## v2026.10.8

### Refusals and `PrvKeyData`'s repr quote less of their argument

A refused network name is quoted only when it is a string of 16 characters or
fewer. `base58.decode` and `utils.str_from_string` chain no error for non-ASCII
input, and `PrvKeyData`'s repr shows only a known network (GHSA-c6h8-5hv5-3gv7).

### `verify_input` reports the ECDSA signatures it accepted

`verify_input`, `verify_transaction` and `verify_script` take a `signatures`
list, and the interpreter appends the (pub_key, signature) pair of every ECDSA
check that succeeds, as Core's `SignatureExtractorChecker` does (closes #2552).

### `reconstruct` raises `ShortIdCollisionError` for colliding short ids

It derives from `BTClibRuntimeError`: Core asks for the whole block there and
BIP152 says the peer is not penalized (closes #2570).

### `PrefilledTransaction.parse` bounds the index only under `check_validity`

With `check_validity=False` it bounds each difference only, as Core's
deserializer does. `CmpctBlock.parse` refuses short ids plus prefilled
transactions past 65535 whatever `check_validity` says (closes #2572).

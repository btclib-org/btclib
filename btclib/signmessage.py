""" Bitcoin (P2PKH) address-based compact signature for messages.

For message signatures, Bitcoin wallets use a P2PKH address-based scheme
with a compact 65 bytes custom signature encoding.
As it is the case for all digital signature scheme, this scheme actually
works with keys, not addresses: it uses a P2PKH address to uniquely
identify a private/public keypair.
This signature proves the control of the private key corresponding to
a given address and, consequently, of the associated bitcoins (if any).
The signature goes along with its address: at verification time
public key recovery is used, i.e. given a message, the public key
that would have created that signature is found and compared with
the provided address.

Note that in the Bitcoin protocol this compact 65 bytes signature
encoding is only used for messages: for transactions Bitcoin uses DER
encoding instead, resulting in 71 bytes signatures on average.

At signing time a wallet infrastructure is required
to access the private key corresponding to the
provided address. For a given message and address, the ECDSA signature
of the hash of "Bitcoin Signed Message" *magic* prefix followed by
the message is calculated; this prefix
manipulation avoids the plain signature of a possibly deceiving message.
The resulting 64 bytes (r, s) signature is serialized as
[1 byte][r][s], where the first byte is a recovery flag used
during the verification process to discriminate among the recovered
public keys and to manage address compression.
Explicitly, the recovery flag value is:

    27 + (IF compressed THEN 4 ELSE 0) + key_id

where:

- 27 identify a P2PKH address (Electrum also supports Segwit P2WPKH-P2SH
  and P2WPKH, but not according to the BIP137 specifications;
  anyway this module and bitcoin core do not support them yet)
- compressed indicates if the address is the hash of the compressed
  public key representation (Segwit is always compressed)
- key_id is the index in the [0, 3] range identifying which of the
  recovered public keys is the one associated to the address;
  it is stored in the least significant 2 bits of the header

+-----------+--------+--------------------+
| rec. flag | key_id |    address type    |
+===========+========+====================+
|     27    |    0   | P2PKH uncompressed |
+-----------+--------+--------------------+
|     28    |    1   | P2PKH uncompressed |
+-----------+--------+--------------------+
|     29    |    2   | P2PKH uncompressed |
+-----------+--------+--------------------+
|     30    |    3   | P2PKH uncompressed |
+-----------+--------+--------------------+
|     31    |    0   | P2PKH compressed   |
+-----------+--------+--------------------+
|     32    |    1   | P2PKH compressed   |
+-----------+--------+--------------------+
|     33    |    2   | P2PKH compressed   |
+-----------+--------+--------------------+
|     34    |    3   | P2PKH compressed   |
+-----------+--------+--------------------+
|     35    |    0   | P2WPKH-P2SH        |
+-----------+--------+--------------------+
|     36    |    1   | P2WPKH-P2SH        |
+-----------+--------+--------------------+
|     37    |    2   | P2WPKH-P2SH        |
+-----------+--------+--------------------+
|     38    |    3   | P2WPKH-P2SH        |
+-----------+--------+--------------------+
|     39    |    0   | P2WPKH (bech32)    |
+-----------+--------+--------------------+
|     40    |    1   | P2WPKH (bech32)    |
+-----------+--------+--------------------+
|     41    |    2   | P2WPKH (bech32)    |
+-----------+--------+--------------------+
|     42    |    3   | P2WPKH (bech32)    |
+-----------+--------+--------------------+

Finally, the serialized signature can be base64-encoded to transport it
across channels that are designed to deal with textual data.
Base64-encoding uses 10 digits, 26 lowercase characters, 26 uppercase
characters, '+' (plus sign), and '/' (forward slash); equal sign '=' is
used as 65th character pad, a complement in the final process of
message encoding.

Warning: one should never sign a vague statement that could be reused
out of the context it was intended for. E.g. always include at least

- your name (nickname, customer id, email, etc.)
- date and time
- who the message is intended for (name, business name, email, etc.)
- specific purpose of the message

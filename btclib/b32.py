"""SegWit address functions.

Some of these functions were originally from
https://github.com/sipa/bech32/tree/master/ref/python,
with the following modifications:

* moved bech32 stuff into bech32.py
* type annotated python3
* avoided returning None or (None, None), throwing Exceptions instead
* detailed error messages and exteded safety checks
* check that bech32 addresses are not longer than 90 characters
  (as this is not enforced by bech32.b32decode anymore)

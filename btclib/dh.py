"""Diffie-Hellman elliptic curve key agreement scheme.

Implementation of the Diffie-Hellman key agreement scheme using
elliptic curve cryptography. A key agreement scheme is used
by two entities to establish shared keying data, which will be
later utilized e.g. in symmetric cryptographic scheme.

The two entities must agree on the elliptic curve and key derivation
function to use.

"""Aliases.

mypy aliases, documenting also coding input conventions.

Octets and String below are both Union[bytes, str], so mypy cannot tell
one from the other: passing a text string where a hex-string is expected
is a type error this file names but no checker can catch. The distinction
is enforced at run time instead, by the converter each function calls on
its way in -- bytes_from_octets for Octets, encode() for String -- and it
is documented here because that is the only place it can be read as one
piece.

Making them NewTypes would let mypy separate them, at the cost of every
caller having to wrap its literals: Octets("deadbeef") instead of
"deadbeef", throughout a public API whose whole style is to accept
whatever is convertible. That is a different library, not a fix to this
one.

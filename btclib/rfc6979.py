"""Deterministic generation of the ephemeral key following RFC6979.

https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6979:

ECDSA and ECSSA need to produce, for each signature generation,
a fresh random value (ephemeral key, hereafter designated as k).
For effective security, k must be chosen randomly and uniformly
from a set of modular integers, using a cryptographically secure
process. Even slight biases in that process may be turned into
attacks on the signature schemes.

The need for a cryptographically secure source of randomness proves
to be a hindranceand and makes implementations harder to test.
Moreover, reusing the same ephemeral key for a different message
signed with the same private key reveal the private key!

RFC6979 turns ECDSA into deterministic schemes by using a
deterministic process for generating the "random" value k.
The process fulfills the cryptographic characteristics in order to
maintain the properties of verifiability and unforgeability
expected from signature schemes; namely, for whoever does not know
the signature private key, the mapping from input messages to the
corresponding k values is computationally indistinguishable from
what a randomly and uniformly chosen function (from the set of
messages to the set of possible k values) would return.
